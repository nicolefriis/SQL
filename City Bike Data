Use a CTE to show the names of every bike lane that has an average safety rating of at least 4.0 (and with an added label of "Safe Lane")

WITH safety_average_cte AS (
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) as 'rating'
FROM citybikelanes
GROUP BY street);

SELECT 
street,
rating,
'safe lane' as 'label'
FROM safety_average_cte
WHERE rating >=4;
